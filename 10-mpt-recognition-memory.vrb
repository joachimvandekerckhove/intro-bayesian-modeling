\begin{itemize}
		\item MPT models make assumptions about how categorical observed behavior can be decomposed into sequences of probabilistic events
		\item The one-high threshold and two-high threshold models of recognition memory are widely-used MPT models
		\item The inferences for the amyloid positivity data showed meaningful differences between the clinical groups, but the exact nature of the differences in remembering and guessing depends on the model
